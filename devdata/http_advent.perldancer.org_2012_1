<div class="pod-document"><h1><a name="another_year_of_dancing___"></a>Another year of Dancing...</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Dancer advent calendar, for the third year running!  Previous
year's calendars have been well received, let's hope this one can live up to
them.</p>
<h2><a name="more_and_more_dancers___"></a>More and more dancers...</h2>

<p>More and more people are using Dancer to power their sites - recent additions to
the <a href="http://dancer.pm/dancefloor">dancefloor</a> include
<a href="http://www.crowdtilt.com/">CrowdTilt</a>,
<a href="http://www.daystack.com/">Daystack</a>,
<a href="http://elibraryusa.state.gov/">eLibraryUSA</a> (US Department of State),
<a href="http://www.maxi-tip.cz/">Maxi Tip</a>,
<a href="http://fbsdmon.org">FreeBSD Monitor</a>,
<a href="http://danceb.in/">Dancebin</a>,
<a href="http://theanarchistlibrary.org/">The Anarchist Library</a> and others.  (Using
Dancer, and happy to have your site featured?  Let us know!)</p>
<h2><a name="dancer2___almost_"></a>Dancer2 - almost!</h2>

<p>Dancer2 has been coming along well, and is already being used in production.
We're at the point now it needs polish, documentation improvements and some
migration guides, and it can hit CPAN!  Dancer2 is a complete rewrite of
Dancer's core, using much better designs, for better maintainability and
extendability, whilst maintaining backwards compatibility with Dancer1's API -
so migrating to Dancer 2 should be quite straightforward.</p>
<p>Expect further articles in the upcoming days with plenty more information on
Dancer 2!</p>
<h2><a name="new_features_in_dancer"></a>New features in Dancer</h2>

<p>Most of our development effort has been going towards Dancer 2, Dancer 1 however
has had many minor improvements and bugfixes, but a few more notable
changes culled from the changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Wallflower_now_shipped_separately"></a><b>Wallflower now shipped separately</b>
<p>BooK's 'wallflower' tool for generating static websites has been removed from
the Dancer distribution, and is now distributed separately as a more
general-purpose tool under the name <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/App::Wallflower">App::Wallflower</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_dancer_response_can_take_HTTP__Headers"></a><b>dancer_response can take HTTP::Headers</b>
<p>You can now pass a <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Headers">HTTP::Headers</a> object to <code>dancer_response</code></p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Dancer2_compatibility_features_in_Dancer__Plugin"></a><b>Dancer2 compatibility features in Dancer::Plugin</b>
<p>Some new keywords are added to Dancer::Plugin to make writing plugins which can
work on both Dancer and Dancer 2 a little easier.  (There are a few minor
differences in how plugins work in Dancer 2; expect an upcoming post on how to
make a plugin compatible with both versions.  Some of the more popular Dancer
plugins have already been updated in readyness.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_new_test_function_response_redirect_location_is"></a><b>new test function response_redirect_location_is</b>
<p>Dancer::Test now provides a <code>response_redirect_location_is</code>, which does as the
name would suggest - tests that the response to a request is a redirect to the
expected location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="new_dancer_plugins"></a>New Dancer plugins</h2>

<p>The Dancer plugin ecosystem continues to grow, with several new Dancer plugins
appearing in 2012:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Dancer__Plugin__Auth__Extensible__Dancer__Plugin__Auth__Extensible__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible">Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Extensible</a></b>
<p>User authentication and authorisation is a common requirement; we had the old
RBAC plugin, but it was in need of some serious work to make it pleasant to use.
In the end, I decided to rock up a new authentication framework plugin for
Dancer, designed to be simple and easy to use, and also easy to extend to
support various authentication sources.  A full article on this will appear in
the upcoming days.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Dancer__Plugin__DictionaryCheck__Dancer__Plugin__DictionaryCheck__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::DictionaryCheck">Dancer::Plugin::DictionaryCheck</a></b>
<p>A new plugin appearing just before this post went up, it's designed to make it
easy to check a password to see if it is a dictionary word, to help stop users
supplying insecure passwords.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Dancer__Plugin__CDN__Dancer__Plugin__CDN__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::CDN">Dancer::Plugin::CDN</a></b>
<p>Provides URLs for static files including a content hash so that the URLs will
change when the content changes, to deal with caching.  Uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::CDN">HTTP::CDN</a> which
can be configured to perform automatic minification/compiling of CSS/JS/LESS.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Dancer__Plugin__Res__Dancer__Plugin__Res__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::Res">Dancer::Plugin::Res</a></b>
<p>Provides syntactic sugar to easily set the response status and return a response
in one go, rather than two steps.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Dancer__Plugin__I18N__Dancer__Plugin__I18N__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::I18N">Dancer::Plugin::I18N</a></b>
<p>Provides internationalisation support for your Dancer apps, using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Locale::Maketext::Simple">Locale::Maketext::Simple</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__a_href__https___metacpan_org_module_Dancer__Plugin__EmptyGIF__Dancer__Plugin__EmptyGIF__a_"></a><b><a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Dancer::Plugin::EmptyGIF">Dancer::Plugin::EmptyGIF</a></b>
<p>Allows you to easily respond with an empty GIF image, with the headers set
appropriately.  This is useful for tracking purposes, if you want to embed an
<code>IMG</code> tag in your HTML to call a route with certain params; in the route, you
can then do whatever logging/other actions you need, then simply return an empty
GIF to the browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="dancer_at_lpw2012"></a>Dancer at LPW2012</h2>

<p>Andrew Solomon ran a free two-hour training course at this year's London Perl 
Workshop - 13 people were registered to attend, but I haven't yet heard how many
did attend.  Andrew's course was a hands-on training session to develop a website
with dynamic content using Dancer, during which the attendees would:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_learn_to_use_the_Dancer_framework"></a><b>learn to use the Dancer framework</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_learn_to_use_Template_Toolkit"></a><b>learn to use Template Toolkit</b>
</li>
<li><a name="item_understand_the_concept_of_Model_View_Controller"></a><b>understand the concept of Model-View-Controller</b>

</li>
<li><a name="item_experience_using_object_oriented_Perl_modules"></a><b>experience using object oriented Perl modules</b>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="dancer_powered_documentation"></a>Dancer-powered documentation</h2>

<p>James Aitken (LoonyPandora) gave a talk at LPW 2012 on 
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/loonypandora/documentation-for-fun-and-profit">Documentation For Fun and Profit</a>
highlighting why good high-level documentation is important, and what you can do to make
it even more useful.  He gave a sneak peak of the REST API documentation and
test console we use at UK2 - more details on this should be coming in a future
post.</p>
<h2><a name="dancer_irc_channel_community_grows"></a>Dancer IRC channel community grows</h2>

<p>The community of helpful users on the Dancer IRC channel continues to grow!  You
can find us on <code>irc.perl.org</code> in <code>#dancer</code> - or <a href="irc://irc.perl.org/dancer">irc://irc.perl.org/dancer</a>
if your system is configured to support <code>irc://</code> links.</p>
<p>If you do not regularly use IRC but wish to join us, there is also a web IRC
client available at <a href="http://dancer.pm/irc">http://dancer.pm/irc</a> for ease of use.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 98 people present in <code>#dancer</code>!</p>
<h2><a name="dancer_repository_move"></a>Dancer repository move</h2>

<p>Dancer's GitHub repository has been moved to the PerlDancer organisation on
GitHub, to make sharing management of the repository and distributing commit
bits where needed far easier - the repository is now found at:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer">https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer</a></p>
<h2><a name="dancer_mailing_list_move"></a>Dancer mailing list move</h2>

<p>Some users were finding that their posts didn't always reach the old mailing
list.  The list has been moved to a new list server, with a new list posting
address: <a href="mailto:dancer-users@dancer.pm">dancer-users@dancer.pm</a>.  The old
address redirects to the new list.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, this was a hastily-put-together look back at 2012; the following days will
have various articles regarding Dancer which I hope will be of interest.  Not
all days are filled yet, so if you wish to write a post for the advent calendar,
please contact me - all assistance would be greatly appreciated!</p>
